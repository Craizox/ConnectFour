# Connect Four

This is a little game that I made, This game is playable in POSIX shell.

## Installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Craizox/ConnectFour.git
$ cd ConnectFour
$ make
```
Then launch the installation script that will just move the executable to
/usr/bin. The script will need the root permission to move the executable
```
$ ./install.sh
```
